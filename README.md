### IT
'**it**' is a Global function (we don't need to import anything)
Receives two parameters:
1) The title of the expectation
2) The assertion, in the form of an anonymous function
TIP: To read the title of the spec, include the word "it" as part of the sentence


'spec' is short for specification
